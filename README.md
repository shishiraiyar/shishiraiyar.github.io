# My personal website

After a failed stint of trying to learn React to make my portfolio website (I don't like React), I decided to rely on good ol' trusty Sveltekit <3. I was initially considering [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but it felt too rigid and it's my portfolio damnit, I want it to look exactly the way I like.
